# Green Schoolyard Thesis Project

This repository contains the R scripts used in the analysis of the Green Schoolyard Study conducted as part of my Master's thesis at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences.

## Project Overview

The project analyzed relationships between recess socialization, physical activity, and school climate perceptions in children, with a focus on differences by body composition. The analysis included statistical modeling and data visualization using R.

## Technologies Used

- R (ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, readr)
- RMarkdown
- REDCap for original data collection (not included here)

## Note on Data Availability

⚠️ **Data Not Included**: The raw data used in this project is confidential and was part of a restricted research study. Due to IRB protocols and data privacy rules, it cannot be publicly shared.

The code files are made available to demonstrate the workflow, analytical methods, and visualization approach.

## Repository Structure

- `scripts/` – R scripts for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization
- `plots/` – Optional folder for saving visual output
- `data/README.txt` – Explanation of data restrictions

## Usage

Clone the repo and explore the R scripts. Replace data loading lines with your own dataset if you'd like to adapt the code to your research.

```r
# Example placeholder
# data <- read.csv("confidential_dataset.csv")
```
